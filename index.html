    <h1>The Basics of the Web</h1>
    <b><h2><u>The web</u></h2></b> The internet is the world's largest computer network, which is comprised of many HTML documents connected together with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink"><em>hyper links.</em></a>
    <p>The web was spun in the early 1990's stemming from the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee.</a></p>
    <br> One can interact with over 30 billion pages by running a program called a browser on their computer. From there, the browser uses HTTP protocol to connect to servers, which are the computers that host the files that make up the web.

    <!-- THe cool thing about coding is that there are many ways to solve any problem! <-->

    <br>
    <h2><u>HTML</u></h2> Hyper Text Markup Language is the Heart of the web.
    <br>
    <br> HTML is made up of:
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>Text content</li>
      <li>Markup</li>
      <li>Refernces to other documents</li>
      <li>Links to other pages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>HTML markup is made up of many tags. You use tags to form elements. Tags allow you to do many things such as add images, video, white space, among many other things. Tags like br, or break, are void tags and do not require a closing tag.
